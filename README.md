## Idea
Idea is to create a simple Diary application for user to store and write diaries. 


## Plus
* Using sql database to store the inputted info.
* Using Internal Service to loop the background music.
* Using OpenWeather API to get the current weather info for the city Helsiki.
* Using System service to get the current date

## Future feature
* Store the data to SD card
* Store the date to clould (need a back-end server)
* Insert pictures into content
* Insert recorded voice into content
* Using fragment in order to make the app responsive 
* Set password for privacy
